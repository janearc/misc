contact information, jane arc
- - -
I keep a phone number, 858-367-7293, which tries to be pointed at whatever
mechanism is the best way to reach me at the moment. This means I get SMS&apos;s,
voice mails, phone calls, and emails via that phone number.

You may also email me at [jane@cpan.org](mailto:jane@cpan.org)

In order of preference, I prefer communication via email, sms, instant
message, and lastly via phone or voice.

With respect to communication, as I live in the America/Tijuana time
zone, you can expect me to be paying attention to communications between
roughly **8am and 6pm** my own time.

the person who authored this is ***jane arc***; there was a name change in early 2015 from jane ***avriette*** to jane ***arc***; the former is my married name. please refer to me as the latter. it takes time to go and change all these places your surname is used after a divorce, but i am getting around to all of them.

* *a word of unsolicited advice:* don&apos;t change your name when you get married.

* *an unsolicited bit of software design advice:* if your software does not allow you to change the username of a user, the problem is *you.*
