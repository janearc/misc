something smells about my cannabis usage
---
something smells about my cannabis usage and it's not what you think. i use cannabis daily and i am pretty open about this. i have a pretty responsible relationship with the drug (it is a drug, let's be clear), and i think i am what you could call a sophisticated user. i am this way because i have been self-medicating with cannabis since i was a teenager. today, when i have a particularly difficult-to-vanquish software bug, i often think, *i should go smoke a joint*, and i have [specific joints](http://www.hepburns.com/our-products/) i use for debugging. when i have a difficult bout of insomnia, i have a variety of [recipes](https://github.com/janearc/veganism/tree/master/recipes/medicated) that i've developed and in fact been refining to help me get to sleep. i have a specific brand of [capsule](http://www.actnowprogram.com/prana-capsules/) i use for both creativity and for anxiety.

i am not shy about telling people about any of this; i am in fact what you'd call a cannabis advocate. i am also a programmer. i am also white. i live in oakland where weed is not just legal, there are dispensaries everywhere.

i want to paint a different story here.

it's 1994. i'm trans, but i don't know that yet. i grow weed in my home to supplement my own habit. it's legal because of prop 215, but people are still going to jail. nobody has ever seen or heard of a "doctor's recommendation", although they supposedly exist, and my doctor "recommended" i use it. i'd certainly be fired for explaining to my then-coworkers that i used cannabis literally every day, let alone i had a preferred brand of weed for debugging. i smoke a fair amount of weed because nobody has actually seen a vaporiser in person, although people i know have heard that in europe the coffee shops have them. i smoke weed for the same reasons i do today -- anxiety and creativity, but also to deal with the crippling depression that comes with being in the closet.

what's changed? let's change the narrative a little bit here.

let's talk about a programmer today, who lives in tulsa, whose name is jane, who is white, who works at a fictional technology company, who has the same preferences for debugging joints, and insomnia pills and so forth, but is somehow by fate, in a place where the legislation is not favourable to her. this person can not only lose her job, but can literally go to jail for these things that i consider to not just be routine but to be integral to my life and to be part of functioning normally -- medicine i use for living.

and let's change this more still.

not everyone is employed as a programmer. maybe let's talk about a person of colour. who does not make as much money as i do. one of the things that i find quite infuriating about this situation of the quasi-legality of cannabis is it places it outside both regulation and coverage of health insurance. this means that i, interestingly, have entire bottles of both pain medicine and anxiety medicine that i simply have not used (whereas before decriminalisation i would have gone through), *people who cannot afford to buy large quantities of cannabis are dependent upon dangerous pharmaceuticals* because *that is what the industry covers* and this is *inherently bad for people*. this is how we get an opioid addiction epidemic.

the other thing is that i have been able to use cannabis for a very long time with literally zero interactions with law enforcement that were related to cannabis. i might literally be in jail today for the decisions i made twenty years ago -- self-medicating for conditions such as being trans, for creativity, and so on. people of colour are policed much more carefully, literally and figuratively, for their relationship with drugs, legal and otherwise, than white people. and so while i enjoy a very frank and open relationship with cannabis, i cannot help but wonder whether engineers i know who are not white are much more careful about their relationship with cannabis (and this makes me quite sad).

all told, the legalisation and decriminalisation of cannabis has brought a wave of privilege to white people, and it continues to pay dividends that white people enjoy the way white people enjoy wine and coffee and brunch. and this makes me very uneasy because it smells of inequality and oppression and i really detest participating in oppression.

despite my having "used weed since before it was cool."
