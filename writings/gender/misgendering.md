This is the first thing I have written publicly about my own gender status - the fact that I am a transgender woman - if this is a surprise to you, there will likely be future missives that cover some of the basics about myself, my own process, how to relate to me (tl;dr: exactly the same as before), and so forth.

#### On misgendering, and why it is an issue

##### A thought experiment
Have you ever been out with a friend and had them point out to you, "hey, you have a piece of spinach stuck to your teeth"? It is kind of embarrassing. It isn't something you can readily see on yourself; it's something that everyone else can see, but generally only if you do a particular thing (smile, laugh, talk, and so on).

You can pick at it or rinse your mouth out or something, but you don't always get it. Particularly pernicious pieces of black pepper or spinach or coffee stains, all these things - they can come back to haunt us later. If this were serious, we might become insecure about this.

Now imagine for a moment having something stuck to your teeth was grounds for being denied access to bathrooms. To restaurants. That if this happened, people might literally want to harm or mock you. Further imagine with me that once somebody had seen this blemish in your teeth that it could not be un-done or removed. Once so identified as she-with-filthy-mouth, you were marked thusly for life.

This is what happens when somebody misgenders you.

Traversing my day-to-day, it almost never actually occurs to me that I am transgender. That at some point in my life, I was regarded as "a man." Why would it? I am sure it does not occur to cisgender people especially often as they walk around, "I am a woman," or "I am a man;" rather, we all have these sorts of cultural rituals and social expectations we call "gender." But because we are sort of steeped in these things, we don't really think about them. Why would we? Aside from "which restroom do I use," it really shouldn't come up in daily life. It certainly doesn't in mine - not very often, anyways.

This is rather like assuming that after you brushed your teeth and left the house this morning, your mouth was free of spinach and black pepper, that your breath was reasonably free of odor, and that your "oral presentation" is what you would expect it to be.

##### What happens when something goes Wrong
Here is a typical, relatively benign example of what can happen during a typical incident of misgendering. Understand that some people react much less dramatically, and some people react much more strongly than I myself did.  Because of certain events that happened to me early-on in my own transition, I have a substantial amount of trauma associated with misgendering.

I had gone to Sephora after work one day to pick up moisturiser. To be very clear, I looked like this:

![Jane, 18th August 2014](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BvWphBZCQAAHOST.jpg)

After being told that I really didn't want a Shiseido product and that I really should go look at the computer and ask it what I wanted, the store employee brought over one of her coworkers, to, presumably, convince me. In doing so, she referred to me as "he" and "him."

The entire day, I had gotten a lot done; I'd written a bunch of software, I'd talked to colleagues. I'd been in meetings. I'd ridden the train an hour in aggregate or so. And it was a lovely day, and I felt pretty great.

Immediately, this all crashed down around me. Immediately, literally the moment these words left her mouth, I became afraid. What is it about my "presentation" - my clothing, my posture, my voice, my mannerisms, et cetera - that leads people to think I am "male"? Quickly this context switches to what changes to their behavior can I now expect? Am I now in danger? Do I have to explain to this person why it is upsetting to me?

Anyone who has had a panic attack recognises this spiral of recursive, almost fractal cogitation. Each thought breaks into four smaller, preceding thoughts, which spin off into consequences and possibilities, all negative.

Because in the past, my safety has come into direct question due to my "not passing as a woman," the idea that I could be in a department store and someone would - accidentally or not - assert that I am not a woman and merely pretending to be so is immensely frightening for me.

In this incident, I immediately left the store. I did not say a word. I turned on my heel and went as fast to the train station as I could, stopping at a trash can to vomit. Upon getting home, I took my makeup off as quickly as I could, threw up again until I hurt from it, and collapsed into bed crying for reasons that I should not have to go into. I stayed there the remainder of the night.

This is a serious thing for me, and you will find for almost all transgender people.

##### But let's also talk about dignity
I will say a few things here that may seem to breach general decorum when it comes to inter-gender relations. I understand that it is seen as kind of gauche for women to talk about "I have breasts, please treat me a certain way," and we often say "no, please don't treat me differently because I have breasts." I hope that you will understand by reading this that the argument I am making is not that I should be treated specially, and that the circumstances necessitate a fairly frank discussion.

When I first explained the idea of misgendering to my friend Devin, she was fairly shocked. "But you have breasts, Jane." I nodded. "No, I mean, you wear a *bra*, Jane. You *obviously* wear a *bra*." I nodded again. "Well, what is their *expletive* problem?"

Devin is correct. What she is implying here is that there are men who are fairly "effeminate." There are also men that, for whatever reason, have developed breast tissue, or who have adipose (fatty) deposits on their chests where we would normally expect female breasts to be.

None of these men wear a bra. It's kind of difficult to conceal the presence of a bra; a brassiere actually presents the breast in a way that is fairly unnatural in appearance as it serves the dual purpose of holding for comfort and also shaping for style. Breasts, naturally, sort of sit limply about the chest and do not provide much of a pronounced profile. Generally.

This is sort of a dead giveaway that someone is wearing women's garments.  That someone is making a deliberate choice to appear female by presenting - *styling* her breasts.

So what is happening when somebody refers to someone who is obviously wearing women's clothing as "he?" Well, first and foremost, they are making a judgment that, despite whatever their appearance, that the "true identity" of this person is in fact male. They are further revealing that they have taken the time to evaluate that person's gender presentation (the aforementioned clothing, posture, voice, secondary sex characteristics, and so forth), and determined that, while it may superficially appear to be female, ultimately, this is a male person - a man.

What does this *actually* mean?

Well, it is incredibly dehumanising. It's invalidating. It's othering. It means that whatever efforts this person has gone to (and if you know anything about gender transition you are aware that it is a process that is so difficult it often - too often - results in a person killing themselves; it is indescribably arduous and painful), whatever their presentation, whatever their wishes, that it's not "good enough" to be judged female. That furthermore, the person has proactively *chosen to refer to them* by a word or name that this person *does not wish for themselves.*

That's pretty disgusting. That this person has gone through this process that is acknowledged to be so difficult as to literally kill people, and is coming to you from what is acknowledged to be a position of deep vulnerability, and the response is to choose to invalidate all that, to choose to, *to their face*, explain that you don't think they deserve to be treated with the dignity of any other woman.

It is exactly equivalent to using an epithet to refer to someone's ethnic background. You know they don't want to be called that, but in your head, they *are* that, and you are referring to them as that *despite their wishing to be treated like a human.* The way *you* want to be treated.

##### But it's a mistake / But it's just a word / Related counter-arguments 

One of the things I have heard most frequently about the use of pronouns, and of using former names (my name is Jane today. Calling me "Joe" because that was my name before is no more acceptable than calling me "him" or "sir") is that "but it's just a word," and "but it's an accident, and you're reacting so heinously!"

Let's be very clear. Words are the substrate that we use to communicate information. That our identities - male, female, professions, ethnicity, adjectives like "dangerous," epithets, *all* words - are deeply significant and important. While it is just a word when it comes out of your mouth, the important thing is that this word refers to a meaning, and that meaning belies the way a person thinks about a thing.

When somebody says that another person is a "terorrist," we de facto remove many of the protections that somebody who is a "soldier" has in society. To further the analogy, it is perceived to be "more okay" to kill a "soldier" or "combatatant" than it is to kill a "civilian." The difference between a "riot" and a "demonstration" is the line we draw between "okay to use teargas" and "peaceful."

So your words, they betray the way you think about things. They betray the way society is expected to treat a person. Words have enormous meaning. They literally are who we are, even though they may be curious glottal stops and diphthongs, morphemes and phonemes, vowels and consonants spewed across a big field of text on a computer.

But to finish this thought on the weight of a word, if words are *not* so meaningful, you have every reason to simply accede to the requests of this person to use their preferred pronoun; for me, this is "she" and related.

You have no reason at all not to. If words are so important, you are commiting an egregious offense by not using the correct word, and if they are not important, you have no reason not to use the correct word.

The other thing we - people who get misgendered - hear a lot is "but it was just a mistake."

The quickest way to refute this is to say "if you run over a pedestrian with your car, it is assumed you did not *mean* to do so. But they are still very much in need of a trip to hospital. They have still been struck by your car. It still happened." The severity of this situation is determined by *the pedestrian*, not by your intent or lack thereof.

Going further with this, though, the important fact is that when you misgender someone, you reveal that you have evaluated their gender in your own head, and you have decided that they are not in fact what they appear to be. That somewhere in your head, I am a man, despite my obvious effort to demonstrate the contrary.

What does this say to me about your opinion of me?

What should I then think about my own safety around you?

Who can I expect you to tell this realisation you've had - that I am actually a man in woman's clothing?

Do you see how quickly this becomes incredibly problematic for me, even if it is "a mistake" for you? That if it is just a syllable for you - "him" - that it is indeed incredibly significant for me?

##### A last note on the perception of men-in-dresses and the like

There is this pehnomenon of "drag." I am the first to admit that I do not know the first thing about drag. I never "cross-dressed" before transitioning, and of course, I am not "cross-dressing" today when I wear a dress.

But I have heard it said that it is *so confusing* that there are "men in drag" such as [Priscilla, Queen of the Desert](http://d3rm69wky8vagu.cloudfront.net/photos/large/4.160374.jpg). There are a couple of points to make here. First, drag performers are almost all cisgender. That is, drag is in fact *performance* for them. For a transgender person, dressing in gender-appropriate clothing is *not* performance. It's going to work. Or out for a burger. Or going to bed.

The other important thing to add here is that almost all drag performers, when performing drag, *prefer to be called by the expected pronouns.* Even if you see a "man in a dress" and they are *clearly* a man in a dress made of flip-flops, this person would *still prefer to be called she* while performing drag.

Furthermore, people who are performing drag *understandably expect attention because they are performing.*

When I go to the supermarket, or I walk into my building at work, or I go to buy moisturiser at Sephora, *I am not performing anything.* What you see is who I am and you should evaluate exactly that.

If I come to you and I am wearing eyeliner and eyeshadow and rouge and a blouse and a skirt and cat-eye spectacles and pumps, there is exactly zero chance that I want to be called "sir," or "him," or "he," even if I am 2 meters tall. Even if my voice is deeper than you'd expect. Even if you, in your miraculous ability to perceive my *"true identity"*, have discerned that I am in fact some kind of very confused man, *you still need to call me ma'am, she, her, and so on.* Because I am a woman. Because you owe it to everyone to treat people with decency. Because I treat you with decency, and I use the pronouns appropriate for you.

Not doing so, for transgender people, can lead to the situation I describe above. Your "mistake," or your "correct perception of my assigned sex at birth" can literally lead to my vomiting up my lunch in a train station in *minutes*.  Can lead to my crying myself to sleep in bed. Can lead to my *fearing for my safety.*

What gives you the right to do this by accident or intent?

What makes this *so important* to you that you must evaluate my gender and decide for yourself whether I am "really" a woman, or some kind of confused man pretending at gender? Really, what gives you the right?
